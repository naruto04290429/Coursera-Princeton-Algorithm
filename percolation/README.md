# Percolation
When I tried to solve the problem, I doe not consider the backwash problem.   
If I applied the virtual top and virtual bottom, it will appear the problem.  
The backwash issue is that some site might be mistakenly judged as a full site.     
A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites.
